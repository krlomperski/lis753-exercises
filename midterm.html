    <h2>About the Used Book Sale</h2>
    <p>
      Every month, the Friends of Palo Alto Library offer more than
      <strong>50,000 used books, records, videos, magazines, and more</strong>.
      Most items come from donations by individuals, estates, and companies, as well as
      books removed from the Palo Alto Library's shelves to make room for new titles.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Room</h2>
    <p>
      The Main Room is along the north driveway next to the Charleston Shopping Center.
      Here you will find a wide selection of general books at low prices.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hardcover books start at <strong>$1</strong></li>
      <li>Paperback books start at <strong>50¢</strong></li>
      <li>You can also drop off large book donations in this room</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Room</h2>
    <p>
      Children's books and family items are in a separate room near the Cubberley track,
      Pavilion and Greendell School. Many items cost <strong>50¢ or $1</strong>.

    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Saturday only:</strong> During the first hour of the sale, please choose no more
      than 12 books at a time and bring them to the cashiers to hold.
    </p>

    <h2>Bargain Rooms</h2>
    <p>
      Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7. Prices are even lower here:

      On <strong>Sunday</strong>, prices in the Bargain Room are <strong>half-off</strong>.
      You can also buy a grocery bag for <strong>$5</strong> and fill it with books.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      The Children's and Bargain Rooms open <strong>one hour earlier</strong> than the
      Main Room on Saturday.
    </p>

    <h2>Gift Certificates</h2>
    <p>
      Gift certificates are available at the sale in <strong>$5</strong> amounts.
      They make an easy gift for any book lover.
    </p>

    <h2>Tickets and Entry on Saturday</h2>
    <p>
      Some customers come early to get a good place in line. To keep things fair,
      we use a simple ticket system at the Main Room on Saturday:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tickets are handed out starting at <strong>8:00 a.m.</strong></li>
      <li>Each person may receive up to <strong>two tickets</strong></li>
      <li>Your ticket number holds your place in line for the Main Room</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can visit the Children's and Bargain Rooms or get coffee after you receive
      your ticket. Please return a few minutes before the Main Room opens.
      If you miss your time, you will lose your place in line and join the end of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      If tickets run out, you can still join the later part of the line.
    </p>

    <h2>Capacity and Book Limits</h2>
    <p>
      Because of space and safety rules, we can allow only
      <strong>160 customers</strong> in the Main Room at one time.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customers are admitted in ticket order from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.</li>
      <li>Each person may take only <strong>12 books</strong> off the shelves at a time</li>
      <li>After you buy those books and exit, you may rejoin the line at the north door</li>
      <li>The 12-book rule may continue past noon if there is still a line outside</li>
    </ul>
